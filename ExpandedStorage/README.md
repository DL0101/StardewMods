# Expanded Storage
Stardew Valley mod which allows Content Pack Creators to add custom storage to the game

# Requirements

* [Json Assets](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1720) is used to add chests to the game

# Compatibility

Custom storages behave exactly like Vanilla Chests so they should be compatible with other mods.

Please report any issues to GitHub Issues

# For Modders

Currently supports a simple Content Pack format requiring only a few lines of json and artwork.

Check out the latest version of [MegaStorage](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4089) as an example.

In the future I'll add API-based loaded for more advanced functionality.

# Credits

Some UI code was derived from the following mods

* [Chests Anywhere](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/tree/develop/ChestsAnywhere) for the implementation of overlays.
* [CJB Item Spawner](https://github.com/CJBok/SDV-Mods/tree/master/CJBItemSpawner) as a reference for up/down arrows and scrolling.

The implementation of carrying chests was derived from [Carry Chest](https://github.com/spacechase0/CarryChest).
