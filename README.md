# Expanded Storage
Stardew Valley mod which allows Content Pack Creators to add custom storage to the game

# Requirements

* [Json Assets](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1720) is used to add chests to the game
* [StardewHack](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3213) patches Chests and Menus to support custom storage and extra capacity

# Compatibility

Custom storages behave exactly like Vanilla Chests so they should be compatible with other mods.

Please report any issues to GitHub Issues

# For Modders

Currently supports a simple Content Pack format requiring only a few lines of json and artwork.

Check out the latest version of [MegaStorage](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4089) as an example.

In the future I'll add API-based loaded for more advanced functionality.
